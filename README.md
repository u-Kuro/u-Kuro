## About Me

I am a passionate computer science student with a diverse skill set and a strong focus on front-end development. I have hands-on experience with various technologies, including:

- **Front-end:** Proficient in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery. I excel in creating interactive and responsive user interfaces while leveraging efficient DOM manipulation techniques.

- **Server-side:** Intermediate proficiency in Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and PHP. I have successfully built dynamic web applications and RESTful APIs using these technologies.

- **Additional Technologies:** Although I have some exposure to Next.js, Python, Java, and C++, my proficiency in these technologies is currently at a lower level. I am eager to further enhance my skills and knowledge in these areas.
