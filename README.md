# Hi there, I'm Reaven Dupitas!

I am currently a computer science student experienced in a wide range of technologies, including vanilla JavaScript for front-end development, where I excel in HTML, CSS, and efficient DOM manipulation using jQuery. Additionally, I have intermediate proficiency in server-side technologies like Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and PHP. While I have some exposure to Next.js, Python, Java, and C++, my current proficiency in these technologies is at a lower level.
