## About Me

I am a computer science student with a diverse skill set and currently focused on front-end development. However, I am also open to gaining experience in other areas. I have hands-on exposure to various technologies, including:

- **Front-end:** Proficient in vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery. I excel in creating interactive and responsive user interfaces while leveraging efficient DOM manipulation techniques.

- **Server-side:** Intermediate proficiency in Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and PHP. I have successfully built dynamic web applications using these technologies.

- **Additional Technologies:** Although I have some exposure to Next.js, Python, Java, and C++, my proficiency in these technologies is currently at a lower level. I am eager to further enhance my skills and knowledge in these areas.
